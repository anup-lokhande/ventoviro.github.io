<ul>
<li><a href="http://joomla.org">Joomla</a> - Most Windwalker packages are based or highly influenced by Joomla.</li>
<li><a href="http://laravel.com">Laravel</a> - Windwalker referenced the Facades pattern from Laravel.</li>
<li><a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> - Windwalker referenced its bundle and console design.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/">Yii</a> - The Database Command is referenced from Yii.</li>
