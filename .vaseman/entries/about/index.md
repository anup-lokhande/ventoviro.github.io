## What is Windwalker

Windwalker is a modern PHP framework based on [Joomla Framework](http://framework.joomla.org), which to simplify web application
developing and provides a RAD environment to speed up the process of creating system prototype.

We are trying to create a lightweight,
ease of use and fully decoupled PHP framework, you can start using Windwalker instantly in any php server
without worrying about the environment setting.

Windwalker is also very strong and flexible, the [package system](../documentation/3.x/core/package-system.html) helps us building
complex enterprise level applications.

We also provides a RAD package called [Phoenix](../rad), with this package, every web development team are able to
establish an usable system prototype with powerful admin UI quickly and continue complete it after multiple iteration.

# Credits

Windwalker incorporated many ideas and work from other well-known Web frameworks. Below is a short list of those Windwalker inspired by.

- [Joomla](http://joomla.org) - Most Windwalker packages are based or highly influenced by Joomla.
- [Laravel](http://laravel.com) - Windwalker referenced the Facades pattern from Laravel.
- [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) - Windwalker referenced its bundle and console design.
- [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/) - The Database Command is referenced from Yii.

In addition, there are many other projects inspired us, and we'll continue contribute back to Joomla.

Thank you, opensource.
