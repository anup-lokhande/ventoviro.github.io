## Register Routing

Open `/etc/routing.yml` and add a new route profile.

```yaml
sakura:
    pattern: /flower/sakura
    controller: Foo\Controller\Myflower
```

If you open `/flower/sakura`, Windwalker will auto find `Foo\Controller\Myflower\GetController` to handle this request.

## Routing in Package

If you are writing routing profiles in package, the controller name can be simpler.

```yaml
# In Flower package
# `src/Flower/routing.yml`

sakura:
    pattern: /sakura
    controller: Sakura
```

Then you can register flower package routing to the main `etc/routing.yml`.

```yaml
# etc/routing.yml

# ...

flower:
    pattern: /flower
    package: flower
```

After registered flower routing, all routes start with `/flower` will be package route, and `/flower/sakura` URI will still matched
`Flower\Controller\Sakura\Controller` because package will help us find `Sakura` controller under this namespace.

See [Package -> Routing Section](package-system.html#add-package-routing)

## Routing Params

### Methods supported:

| Method    | Mapped Controller |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `GET`     | `GetController` |
| `POST`    | `SaveController` |
| `PUT`     | `SaveController` |
| `PATCH`   | `SaveController` |
| `DELETE`  | `DeleteController` |
| `HEAD`    | `HeadController` |
| `OPTIONS` | `OptionsController` |

> NOTE: Windwalker mapped POST, PUT and PATCH to `SaveController`, which includes both create and update action.
> If you want to separate create and update to two controllers, see next section to override actions.

### Override Actions

Add the action attribute:

```yaml
flower:
    pattern: /flower/sakura
    controller: Flower\Controller\Sakura
    action:
        get: IndexController
```

Then the GET method will match `Flower\Controller\Sakura\IndexController` because we set a map to find new name. We can set more
methods to map methods with controllers.

```yaml
flower:
    pattern: /flower/sakura
    controller: Flower\Controller\Sakura
    action:
        get: IndexController
        post: CreateController
        put: UpdateController
        delete: DeleteController
```

Use `|` as OR condition:

```yaml
flower:
    pattern: /flower/sakura
    controller: Flower\Controller\Sakura
    action:
        get|post|put: IndexController
        delete: false # false means not allowed
```

Or use wildcard to map all methods to one controller:

```yaml
    action:
        '*': SakuraController
```

### Override Methods

If you want to send `PUT` and `DELETE` method from web form, you may add `_method` params in URL query, this param will override
real HTTP method. For example, send `&_method=DELETE` will ask Windwalker to use `DeleteController`.

If you feel the HTTP standard methods are not enough to use for you, you can add your custom methods.

```yaml
    action:
        export: ExportController
```

Then use `&_method=EXPORT` and the `ExportController` will be executed.

### Custom Input Variables

```yaml
    pattern: /flower/(id)/(alias)
    variables:
        foo: bar
```

The attributes in `variables` will auto set to request as default value if this route be matched and there is no same param name in HTTP query.
So if this route matched, you can get `foo` value in controller:

```php
$this->input->get('foo'); // bar
```

But if you type `/flower/25/alias?foo=yoo`, then you will get `yoo`, the variable will be override by HTTP query.

### Extra Params

The `variables` will auto set to input request so it is danger to store some sensitive settings in `variables`, we can set
`extra` params instead.

```yaml
    pattern: /flower/(id)/(alias)
    extra:
        layout: grid
        user:
            access: admin
```

Then you can get this extra params from [global config](./config.html).

```php
// In enywhere
$config = Ioc::getConfig();

$config->get('route.extra.user.access'); // admin

// OR in controller
$this->app->get('route.extra.user.access'); // admin
```

### Hooks

You can add `match` and `build` hooks to every route.

```yaml
flower:
    pattern: /flower/sakura
    controller: Flower\Controller\Sakura
    hook:
        match: MyRouteHandler::match
        build: MyRouteHandler::build
```

The hook example:

```php
use Windwalker\Core\Router\RestfulRouter;
use Windwalker\Router\Route;

/**
 * The MyRouteHelper class.
 *
 * @since  {DEPLOY_VERSION}
 */
class MyRouteHandler
{
	/**
	 * Match hook, will execute after route matched.
	 *
	 * @param RestfulRouter $router   The Router object.
	 * @param Route         $route    The route object.
	 * @param array         $method   The method to match route.
	 * @param array         $options  The options to match route.
	 *
	 * @return  void
	 */
	public static function match(RestfulRouter $router, Route $route, $method, $options)
	{
		// Do something
	}

	/**
	 * Build hook, will execute after every route building.
	 *
	 * @param RestfulRouter $router   The Router object.
	 * @param string        $route    The route name.
	 * @param array         $queries  The HTTP query to build route.
	 * @param string        $type     Build type, 'raw', 'path' or 'full'.
	 * @param boolean       $xhtml    Encode special chars or not.
	 *
	 * @return  void
	 */
	public static function build(RestfulRouter $router, &$route, &$queries, &$type, &$xhtml)
	{
		// Do something
	}
}
```

### Allow Methods

The yaml request will be ingnored according if it did not satisfy the given conditions. For example this config will only allow GET and POST, while PUT and DELETE will be ignored.

```yaml
flower:
    pattern: /flower/sakura
    controller: Flower\Controller\Sakura
    method:
        - GET
        - POST
```

### Allow scheme

```yaml
flower:
    pattern: /flower/sakura
    controller: Flower\Controller\Sakura
    method:
        - GET
        - POST
    ## Only http & https
    scheme: http
    post: 80
    sslPort: 443
```

## Route Pattern

### Simple Params

Use parenthesis `()` to wrap param name.

```yaml
    pattern: /flower/(id)/(alias)
```

For uri look like : `/flower/25/article-alias-name`, above pattern will be matched and there will be two input params.

```html
[id] => 25
[alias] => article-alias-name
```

##### Use Requirements to Validate Params

Use Regular Expression to validate type of input. For example `\d+` indicates that only `Integer` will be accepted as `id` input.

```yaml
    pattern: /flower/(id)/(alias)
    requirements:
        id: \d+
```

### Optional Params

##### Single Optional Params

Use `(/{anyparam})` to wrap an Optional Param.

```yaml
    pattern: flower(/id)
```

Below 2 uris will be matched simultaneously.

```
/flower
/flower/25
```

##### Multiple Optional Params

```yaml
    pattern: flower(/year,month,day)
```

All uris below will be matched.

```
/flower
/flower/2014
/flower/2014/10
/flower/2014/10/12
```

Matched variables:

```
Array
(
    [year] => 2014
    [month] => 10
    [day] => 12
)
```

### Wildcards

Use Wildcards to match all the successive params in uri.

```yaml
    pattern: /king/(*tags)
```

Every param after `/king` will all be matched. For example: `/king/john/troilus/and/cressida`, will get these variables.

```
Array
(
    [tags] => Array
    (
        [0] => john
        [1] => troilus
        [2] => and
        [3] => cressida
    )
)
```

## Build Route

Every route in Windwalker has a key, which allows every single route pattern can be access 
by **route name** or **route resources**, this will be helpful building a route quickly.

```php
echo \Windwalker\Core\Router\CoreRouter::route('{route name}', array('id' => 25, 'alias' => 'foo-bar-baz'));
```

The output will be:

```html
{route name}/25/foo-bar-baz
```

This is a very useful function that you can change roue name but don't need to worry about invalid link.

For further information, see: [Route and Redirect](../mvc/uri-route-building.html)

## Matchers

Windwalker Router provides some matchers to use different way to match routes.

You can set matcher name in `/etc/config.yml`:

```yaml
routing:
    matcher: default
```

The default matcher is Sequential Matcher.

### Sequential Matcher

Sequential Matcher use the [Sequential Search Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search) to find route.
It is the slowest matcher but much more customizable. It is the default matcher of Windwalker Router.

### Binary Matcher

Binary Matcher use the [Binary Search Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) to find route.
This matcher is faster than Sequential Matcher but it will break the ordering of your routes. Binary search will re-sort all routes by pattern characters.

### Trie Matcher

Trie Matcher use the [Trie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) tree to search route.
This matcher is the fastest method of Windwalker Router, but the limit is that it need to use an simpler route pattern
which is not as flexible as the other two matchers.

### Rules of TrieMatcher

##### Simple Params

only match when the uri segments all exists. If you want to use optional segments, you must add two or more patterns.

``` html
/flower
/flower/:id
/flower/:id/:alias
```

##### Wildcards

This pattern will convert all segments after `/flower` to an array which named `tags`:

```html
/flower/*tags
```
