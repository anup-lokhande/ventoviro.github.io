$ composer create-project windwalker/starter project_dir ~3.0
```

```

The [Starter](https://github.com/ventoviro/windwalker-starter) package is a default application help us start a project.

### Use Windwalker as Library

If you just want to use Windwalker as a library, add `windwalker/framework` as your project's dependencies in `composer.json`.

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "windwalker/framework": "~3.0"
    }
}
```

> `~3.0` is equivalent to 3.0 to 3.9

You can also pick any child packages rather than the complete framework set. This is an example to install Session and Form package:

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "windwalker/session": "~3.0",
        "windwalker/form": "~3.0"
    }
}
```

See all available packages on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/windwalker/)
